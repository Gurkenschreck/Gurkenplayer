Coop or competitive/independent mode?

COOP:
==stuff to synchronize
->money (current account balance, profit and loss, loan)	==OK EcoExtBase.cs
->citizens
->area demand												==OK DemandExtBase.cs
->buildings and streets (and removal of both)
->current speed and time (disable speed options?)			==Half ok. Only same speed.
->current and bought tiles
->???

Competative/Independent mode 
==stuff to synchronize
->buildings and streets (and removal of both)
->current speed and time									==Half ok. Only same speed.
->???

International mode (competative/multiplayer leaderboard)
->Leaderboard with important information about the player
->Many players can play
->Possible player interactions could be sending money, etc.
->Not much to sync

ToDo for every mode:
-Create a configuration window at the start of the game
-How to start the multiplayer session? Only new game?

-Remove the assembly version (https://github.com/SkylinesModding/Docs/commit/e722e478083cb940a7de3dcaf5607aa2d198b4a3)

Notes:
ICities.dll -> Official modding API
Assembly-CSharp.dll -> Contains almost all of the gameplay related classes. (Road system, citizens, buildings, chirper, usw)
ColossalFramework.UI -> The UI that is used by the game. Is used to create your own UI components.

Current procedure:
-both start the game with the same world (must have the same mods (or even none)?)
-on level load force stop the game
-open window where you can create a server lobby or connect to a game. (Configuration)
-you have to configure the amount of connections in setup
-open server and wait till its full/startable
-if it is full/startable, show a message on server with 'start game'
-onclick remove force stop of the game
-play
